# iMatch
CS-546 Final Project

## Project iMatch

Overview

Project iMatch is a web application that can assign a class of students into groups based on location and availability in order to complete a group project. Students can sign into Project iMatch and complete their member profile including where they live or work and what days of the week and time of day they are available to collaborate. Professors can use Project iMatch to set maximum group sizes or number of groups and upload a class roster. The application then sorts students into groups based on matching schedules and locations that adhere to the group size the professor set. With the help of the Google Maps API, Project iMatch can even suggest a convenient and equidistant meeting spot based on the location of students in a group.
